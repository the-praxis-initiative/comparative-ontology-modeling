# Same Data, Different Model: Choosing an Ontology Modeling Methodology

## Abstract
As knowledge graph development (and in particular the development of their schemas) grows commensurately with the importance of knowledge graphs in industry and academia, it follows that choosing a development methodology to fit the application scenario and domain is correspondingly important. We thus propose a 3-hour, hands-on tutorial for the purposes of comparing and contrasting three distinct ontology modeling methodologies: Modular Ontology Modeling (MOMo), Domain Reference Ontology Design (DROD), and Knowledge Acquisition and Representation Methodology (KNARM). Attendees will have the opportunity to execute each methodology. The tutorial will culminate in a retrospective for the different sub-tutorials. The tutorial can be effectively run in any mode.
