# Same Data, Different Model: Choosing an Ontology Modeling Methodology

## Abstract
As knowledge graph development (and in particular the development of their schemas) grows commensurately with the importance of knowledge graphs in industry and academia, it follows that choosing a development methodology to fit the application scenario and domain is correspondingly important. We have thus organized a 3-hour, hands-on tutorial for the purposes of comparing and contrasting three distinct ontology modeling methodologies: Graphical Modular Ontology Modeling (GraphMOMo), Extreme Design for Ontology Engineering (xD), and LLM-assisted Knowledge Engineering (copilot). Attendees will have the opportunity to execute each methodology. The tutorial will culminate in a retrospective for the different sub-tutorials. 

## Schedule (3hrs)
1. Introduction (20 minutes)
2. [Graphical Modular Ontology Modeling](./sessions/graphical/graphical.md) (40 minutes)
3. [Extreme Design](./sessions/xd/xd.md) (40 minutes)
4. [AI-Assisted Knowledge Engineering](./sessions/copilot/copilot.md) (40 minutes)
5. Comparative Analysis & Discussion (40 minutes)
