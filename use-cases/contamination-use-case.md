# Use Case

## Background
PFAS are problematic - and they are seemingly everywhere.
They have been widely used for their unique properties (cook ware, plastic wrap, carpeting, fire fighting foam, etc.) but are deemed a health concern to humans and animals. They are extremely long lasting, thus potentially accummulating in the environment and in water and food sources. While they have been detected in water, soil and agricultural products (e.g. grains, dairy, produce) they overall impact on the food and water supply are not yet fully known. Various national and state agencies are ramping up testing to get a better understanding of PFAS. 

## Scenario
Let's put us in the shoes of a government agency, like EPA or a similar state agency, that is trying to get a better handle on:
* the extent of the problem, 
* where and how to prioritize testing for PFAS, 
* contamination is most problematic in the state or country, 
* how PFAS contamination is affecting environment and health of their communities,  
* how to ensure safe food and water for their communities, and 
* where there are serious gaps in the knowledge about PFAS in the state/country.

In order to address these questions, we have been asked to build a knowledge-driven platform that integrates any relevant existing data. 


## Example Competency Questions
* What are PFAS? Which ones are of concern? 
* Is the water in region _R_ contaminated?
* What has been sampled in town _T_? 
* What constitutes safe exposure to PFAS? 
* Which sample results in town _T_ are concerning and require follow-up investigation? 
* Has my water system been contaminated in the past?
* Where is the most contaminated water system in the state? US?
* Who is currently sampling for PFAS in the state/country?
* Which wells that are close to sites where (potentially PFAS-contaminated) sewage sludge has been spread have never been tested?  
* What else in the food and water chain may be impacted by this sample result from Well _W_?
* What sources may explain the high level of PFAS in this dairy sample?
* Is this sample from Well _W_ an outlier? 
* Does the region with the highest contamination have a high cancer incidence?
* In which agricultural food products have the highest levels of PFAS been measured? 
* Which food products are the biggest contributors to human intake of PFAS? 
* What impact do PFAS have on my body?
* What impact do PFAS have on the environment?
