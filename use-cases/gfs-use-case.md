# Use Case

## Description
The global food system is comprised of tightly woven and highly interconnected subsystems, from logistics, ecosystems, geopolitical entities, agriculture, economics and the events that impact them, such as climate change or disasters. However, these systems are not stable or uniform, and in times of global climate and health uncertainty, increasingly difficult to predict. They vary across regions and time, and they form complex interaction networks. For instance, changing cultural norms may require an adjustment of a system even though these may not strictly be optimal from another perspective. Conversely, society has to adapt to changes in the environment, e.g., to ensure the long-term sustainability of natural resources. Decision-makers also need to account for regional aspects and systemic interactions between neighboring regions that, to date, are often considered in isolation.

Furthermore, the data used to inform these decisions is generated at a pace that no human can ingest, let alone understand. It is too rapid, too multivariate, and too interlinked. Alternatively, there can be disconnected data, either from each other, or from the procedural knowledge used to generate it. This confusing tangle of data and processes, coupled with the high volume of each can lead to significant problems and barriers to understanding the current state of the art - and the world.
