# Modular Ontology Modeling

## Overview

## Objectives

## References & Resources
Here are some useful links things during the MOMo process.

### Modular Knowledge Graphs
* [Enslaved Hub](https://enslaved.org/)
* [KnowWhereGraph](https://knowwheregraph.org/)

### Pattern Resources
* [Axiom Patterns](https://daselab.cs.ksu.edu/sites/default/files/Expressibility_of_OWL_%20Axioms_with_Patterns.pdf)
* [MODL](https://github.com/kastle-lab/modular-ontology-design-library)
* [ontologydesignpatterns.org](https://ontologydesignpatterns.org/)

### Tools
* [yEd](https://yworks.com/yed) -- for (only) graph diagram editing
* [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) -- for `ttl` generation
* [CoModIDE](https://comodide.com/) -- arguably also a pattern resource, it provides a graphical canvas for Protégé with pattern support.

## Process
1. Define the use case(s). <br>
This is already done for us.
2. Develop competency questions. <br>
This is already done for us.
3. Identify key notions.
- placeholder
- placehodler
4. Match patterns to key notions.
5. Instantiate the patterns to create modules.
6. Systematically axiomatize each module.
7. Assemble the modules.
8. Review the final product.
9. Produce artifacts (e.g., documentation and serialization).
